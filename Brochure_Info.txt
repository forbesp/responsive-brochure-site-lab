Grevillea
Many species of grevilleas are popular garden plants as they look beautiful, have a diverse range of flowers and leaf shape, and are bird attracting.


Banksia
Banksias are heavy producers of nectar, making them an important source of food for nectivorous animals, including honeyeaters and small mammals such as honey possums, pygmy possums, gliders and bats.


Acacia
Acacia, commonly known as the wattle, is a large genus of shrubs and trees. They are fast growing in the garden and are great to fill a gap. The Golden Wattle is Australia's National floral emblem.


Callistemon
Mostly known as the Bottlebrush due to the shape and look of the flower head, these flower profusely mostly in the warmer months. They are bird attracting and can be grown in a pot.


Westringia
The popular Westringia owes its common names, ‘native rosemary’ or ‘coastal rosemary’, more to the shape of its leaves than any distinctive aroma. The leaves are often covered with an attractive contrasting grey or white velvety sheen.


Melaleuca
Melaleucas are mostly pollinated by insects, including the introduced honey bee, flies, beetles and wasps and is popular with birds such as lorikeets and honeyeaters as well as bats. A common name is tea tree, and this is where tea tree oil comes from. They are also know as paper bark trees due to the bark peeling off like sheets of paper.
